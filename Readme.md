CyanogenMod CM-13.0 CAF for the Moto G 2013 (falcon)
====================================================

	This ROM is basically my custom CM13.0. It's not about features but just underground bringup.
I made the kernel myself, I modified the trees myself and we are using the latest MSM8226 CAF display/audio/media HALs.

*Credits*

	However, this ROM couldn't be such as good without a few peoples :

- sultanxda, who cherry-picked a lot of cpufreq/PM commits from CAF I couldn't have found without him and they are contributing to the kernel stability
- the CodeAurora Forums guys, who made the kernel base
- Motorola, to provide us with an awesome opensource github (MotorolaLLC)
- Me, for the past 6 months I spent on this kernel re-doing it over and over until I'm satisfied.

*How to sync and build*

	To sync just add the local_manifest.xml in your .repo/local_manifests/
	To build follow github.com/CyanogenMod/android instructions

Enjoy.
